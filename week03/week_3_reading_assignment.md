# Week 3 Reading Assignment: Geoff Boeing
#### The more and more I study for this class, the more intrigued I am by the spatial data science component to planning and not only how niche it is (there are entire academic departments dedicated to just urban data science), but also how useful it is in terms of visualizing human movement across a specific landscape. While watching Yoh's class discussion with Boeing, students began to ask about the impacts of grid streets in the city and how they are often correlated with low-income neighborhoods. As former ethnic studies student, I learned that the grid system in LA orginated with [Spanish colonizers and their decisions to orient the first streets at a diagonal in order to control indigenous peoples](https://www.kcet.org/shows/lost-la/why-l-a-has-clashing-street-grids). These methods in planning are very simlar to what Boeing named as "tracking development through grid plans," as they are forms of controlling and surveilling space, especially low income neighborhoods. I am interested in learning if Boeing (or any other urban data scientist!) has explored how data science, grid systems, and policing all relate to each other. I think it's great how he brought up redlining and harmful highway development, which are all more modern tools of spatial control, but I'd be interested to explore how these practices originated long before freeways broke ground.
