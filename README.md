# About me
Hello, my name is Adriana (pronouns are she/they) and I am a second-year Master of Urban and Regional Planning candidate at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. While I am currently concentrating in Design and Development, I am also interested in housing justice and equitable transportation design; *it is a challenge choosing just one concentration for this program, as __all__ planning areas intersect!* Prior to starting this program I worked on various spatial justice issues as a community organizer in Long Beach. In my free time I enjoy taking photos on film, spending time with my pup and loved ones, and exploring coffee shops. I was born and raised in East Oakland, CA and am a proud daughter of immigrants hailing from Michoacán, México. 
# Course description
Understand data science as a tool to research, visualize, and communicate trends relevant to the world of planning, utilizing open-source methods.
# Project ideas
- Identify places where accessory dwelling units can be constructed as a way to accomodate low-income multi-generation families
- Where do LA County families relocate post-displacement?
# Class objectives
I intend to understand mapping in a manner that can be accessible beyond academic labs and workplaces that have the funding for licensing. I will be learning about the basics of data science and programming, and will produce visualizations of data that will be useful in decision making and policy.
